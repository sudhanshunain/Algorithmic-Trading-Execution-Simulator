## üí° Project Background

During my summer internship at **26 Miles Capital**, I worked as a **Quantitative Researcher**, developing and testing algorithmic trading strategies for high-frequency environments.  

While my primary task was to **design and analyze trading strategies**, I developed a deep curiosity about **how orders are executed at the microstructure level** ‚Äî particularly through **order books** and **execution algorithms**.  

This project, *Algorithmic Trading Strategies Simulator*, is a result of that curiosity.  
It simulates how a strategy like **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)** executes large parent orders into smaller child orders under time and market constraints ‚Äî a critical concept in execution algorithms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implemented Strategy

### **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)**  
TWAP slices a large order into equal parts that are executed evenly over a defined time period.  
This helps minimize **market impact**, **slippage**, and **information leakage**.

**Mathematical Definition:**  
\[
TWAP = \frac{\sum_i (Price_i \times TimeInterval_i)}{TotalTime}
\]

In this discrete-time simulator, orders are placed at uniform intervals.
